This C++ code decodes a secret message using a provided cipher key. It interacts with the user and performs the following tasks:

1. Obtains the file names of the coded message and the cipher text key.
2. Reads the coded message into an array and sorts it.
3. Decodes the message using character location information from the cipher key.
4. Prints the decoded message.

The program utilizes functions for various tasks like file handling, array manipulation, sorting, and decoding. It deciphers the message character by character using the provided key, extracts page numbers, line numbers, and character positions to decode the message.
